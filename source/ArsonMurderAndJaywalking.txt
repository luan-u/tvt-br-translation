When listing three or more things, the comedy rule is to ''not'' finish strong, but to list some strong examples followed by a very weak example, [[RuleOfFunny for the funny]]. Sometimes this will stick to the RuleOfThree, but sometimes a proper LongList will increase the humor.

In the US and Canada, "jaywalking" means crossing the road in a dangerous manner, particularly ignoring the crosswalks when crossing city streets. In many other countries, not only are there almost no restrictions on where you can cross, but the idea of someone being fined for crossing the road is alien. In places where jaywalking is illegal, including France and Poland for example, it's usually an infraction (i.e. like a parking ticket) rather than a proper criminal offense, and some cities don't even bother to enforce it.

Compare PokeThePoodle, SkewedPriorities, AllCrimesAreEqual, JaywalkingWillRuinYourLife (when the minor crime carries significant consequences) and WorstNewsJudgementEver (where jaywalking is the main headline over arson and murder). The inverse is BreadEggsMilkSquick, where a list of seemingly mundane things ends with something much darker. ClueEvidenceAndASmokingGun is a related inverse that deals with deductions rather than listing things. This can also overlap with TakeThat, in cases where the speaker/writer is jokingly implying that the last item on the list is equally as horrible (or even more so) as the serious bad things earlier in the list.
