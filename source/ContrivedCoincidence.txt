->''"I don't mean to spoil the party, but does anyone else notice that we're stuck in the middle of the ocean on this couch? I mean, it's not like a big gigantic ship is just gonna come out of nowhere and save us– MY GOSH!!"''
-->-- '''Franchise/{{Batman}}''', ''WesternAnimation/TheLEGOMovie'', when Metalbeard's ship does just that

In order to keep a story moving, things need to happen a certain way. Sometimes everything is carefully set up and orchestrated, so that events unfold in an organic, natural fashion. More often than not, though, things happen the way they do simply BecauseDestinySaysSo.

There's just one tiny little problem with that theory: Sometimes, Destiny ''doesn't'' say so.

Contrived Coincidence describes a highly improbable occurrence in a story which is required by the plot, but which has absolutely no outward justification — not so much as a character saying ThereAreNoCoincidences. The concept of "destiny" is glossed over altogether, and the events in question are simply disguised as mere happenstance. This would be jarring, but most of the time no attention is drawn to the event at all. It's just a narrative convention designed to skip over lots of irrelevant stuff by putting the important events all together, leaving the audience to forget the improbability of the event.

In cases where the coincidence is acknowledged, it's likely a LampshadeHanging. Unlikely coincidences are bound to happen once in a while. Exceptional things don't happen to the main characters ''because'' they are main characters; rather, they are designated main characters ''because'' exceptional things happen to them. In other words, there would be no story without this first exceptional coincidence. The earlier in the story the plot-driving coincidences occur, the more leeway the writer has with them.

Contrived Coincidence is one of the driving forces of {{Farce}}, decreed by the RuleOfFunny. This is a major reason why wariness is needed in other genres; too much of it will make the story farcical.

Make note that like its sister trope TheoryOfNarrativeCausality, this is one of the most pervasive tropes out there. Remember though, that just because a work [[Administrivia/TropesAreTools uses this trope]] is not an automatic black mark against it. Even the greatest works out there sometimes need a great leap to get the plot to go in an interesting direction.

Too many contrived coincidences may result in OneDegreeOfSeparation. For a more grandiose or plot-wrapping version, see DeusExMachina. A person who is a WeirdnessMagnet tends to be a walking contrived coincidence. Often, these can disguise a GambitRoulette as ThePlan. If the story's premise is this trope or relies on it, it's ItBeganWithATwistOfFate instead. FramingTheGuiltyParty invokes this trope when the one doing the framing didn't know that party was already guilty. DiedOnTheirBirthday is when death just so happens to also coincide with the calendar date on which one was born.

SuperTrope to CoincidentalBroadcast and ItsASmallWorldAfterAll.

Compare with DoomMagnet. See also FridgeLogic (or NotMyDriver), for the moment the character realizes this trope. Supertrope of {{Hellistics}}, when unrelated events turn out to be connected with each other just to screw over the character(s).
