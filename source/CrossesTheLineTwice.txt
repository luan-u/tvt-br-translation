->''"I may disapprove of a movie for going too far, and yet have a sneaky regard for a movie that goes much, much farther than merely too far."''
-->-- '''Creator/RogerEbert''' on ''Film/ShootEmUp''

''"[[BlackComedy Pain is funny.]] Therefore, more pain must be even funnier!"''

Thus goes the logic in a lot of comedy shows and a few adult cartoons. Sadly, that's not the case. The line separating ''Film/TheThreeStooges''-style painful fun from outright villainous {{squick}}y sadism varies from person to person but is definitely there; crossing it makes one fan's ''[[TheChewToy "Nyuk nyuk!"]]'' another fan's GuiltyPleasures.

However, if a show goes far enough with its violence, it may end up crossing the line not once but ''twice'', as it goes around the planet and crosses it again. This second crossing takes the violence from sick back to funny in its ridiculous extremes. Similar to SoBadItsGood, but done quite intentionally.

This isn't as easy as it sounds. Shows attempting to be DarkerAndEdgier with their humor this way straddle the line between sadism and comedy, and it's easy to make a mistake and fall on the wrong side of the S.S. Tightrope. Rather than cross the line a second time, the show [[MemeticMutation makes a]] WrongTurnAtAlbuquerque and breaks the audience's WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief. [[MoralGuardians Some people]] just don't have a second line to cross in their minds, and will [[DudeNotFunny dislike]] any turn into sadism or vulgarity.

This can also apply to things other than violence for [[RuleOfFunny funny's sake]]; any time a little exaggeration would provoke a negative reaction, but exaggeration is fine, that's crossing the line twice. Take action scenes, for example: some shows try to keep action scenes realistic in order to seem believable, while others go so far over the top that it breaks the audience's WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief. Still, others take the over-the-top so over the top that what was before unbelievable garbage is now heart-wrenching, adrenaline-rushing, undiluted '''[[SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome AWESOME]]'''. Of course, this form of the trope is just as subjective as the last, so be careful what you put down as an example.

See also BlackComedy, BloodyHilarious, RefugeInAudacity, VulgarHumor. If this happens completely by accident, that's SpringtimeForHitler. Part of the SlidingScaleOfComedyAndHorror. When this trope ''isn't'' taken to extreme, over-the-top levels, it's mere ComedicSociopathy. When it succeeds in being offensive but not so much at comedy, it's DudeNotFunny.

The HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood depends on this trope, piling misfortune on misfortune until it becomes so ridiculous it's funny. For instance, the BoardingSchoolOfHorrors in ''Radio/BleakExpectations'' would be abusive if the staff beat the students and deprived them of food. That they use the boys as ammo for artillery practice and make them play a game where the smallest boy is chosen as the ball, kicked and punched across the field, and finally has his head shoved in a bucket of manure to score a goal is just silly.

This is also the way the HeroicComedicSociopath holds the audience's hearts. This character does evil in such an over-the-top, outrageous fashion that the audience stops feeling any moral qualms, because it's so over-the-top and out of line that it becomes ''hilarious'' instead.

Compare ActuallyPrettyFunny, when even the target of the joke concedes the humor of the situation.
