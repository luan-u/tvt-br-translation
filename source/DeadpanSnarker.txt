A character prone to gnomic, sarcastic, sometimes bitter, occasionally whimsical asides.

The Deadpan Snarker exists to deflate pomposity, [[LampshadeHanging point out the unlikelihood of]] [[ZanyScheme certain]] [[GambitRoulette plans]], and deliver funny lines. Typically the [[SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism most cynical]] [[SourSupporter supporting character]]. In most cases, it is implied that the snarker would make a good leader, strategist, or consultant given their ability to [[GenreSavvy instantly see the flaws in a constructed plan]]. More often than not, their innate snarkiness is the only thing preventing the other characters from comprehending this for themselves. In other cases, the Deadpan Snarker resorts to sarcasm because they're the OnlySaneMan. Tends to be shot a DeathGlare when they go too far (and probably isn't without one of their own, either). Note that due to the definition evolving, the "Deadpan" part of the title has gradually become TheArtifact and a deadpan delivery is no longer a necessary part of the trope.

Sometimes the Deadpan Snarker is shown to be incapable of avoiding sarcasm, due to their insecurity about expressing any genuine thought or feeling, and their fear of withdrawing from the cynical position and protection. This may turn them into a StepfordSnarker.

While the Snarker has existed (in both fiction and RealLife) since time immemorial, its most contemporary incarnation emerged in the early 1930s with the new popularity of sound cinema and the rise of "zinger" comedy. In fact, it was in 1933 that the word "wisecrack" (the Snarker's most trusted sidearm) entered English-language dictionaries. (And, in a stroke of genius, [[ShapedLikeItself the word "wisecrack" is itself a wisecrack]], carrying the sarcastic connotation of "Oh, yeah, you're a real Creator/{{Socrates}}, smart guy.")

A sub-trope of this is GradeSystemSnark. Compare TheSnarkKnight, LittleMissSnarker, {{Cuckoosnarker}}, WeaselMascot, FirstPersonSmartass, ServileSnarker, GentlemanSnarker, SilentSnarker, DisabledSnarker, MentorInSourArmor. See also NonActionSnarker, SnarkyNonhumanSidekick, CatsAreSnarkers, TallDarkAndSnarky, SurroundedByIdiots, SiliconSnarker, and SarcasticDevotee. Sometimes overlaps with GenreSavvy and NoSenseOfHumor. A common role for a StraightMan. May wear JadeColoredGlasses. Expect them to resort frequently to BrutalHonesty. If there are too many of these, you might be in a WorldOfSnark. Overdoing it on one character may result in a {{Jerkass}}; even when done in sufficient moderation, however, the character still tends to rely on a certain amount of JerkassDissonance (since, well, the audience would probably be less amused by the Deadpan Snarker's biting wit if ''they'' were the ones on the receiving end of it). Expect plenty of SnarkToSnarkCombat if and when two of these meet. May result in OffingTheMouth. Try not to confuse the dialogue with BuffySpeak. It's common among narrators, making them into a LemonyNarrator.
