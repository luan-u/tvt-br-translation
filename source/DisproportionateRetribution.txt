In some situations, it makes sense to let the opponent know that if they so much as sneeze on [[MamaBear someone]] [[PapaWolf you]] {{protect|orate}}, it will cost them a limb. If you have tried an eye for an eye and it really didn't do anything except help sell eyepatches, the only way to stay alive is to be drastic. Pay back any offense tenfold, or even a hundredfold if necessary, until the survivors learn to stay away and/or do everything in their power to keep you in a good mood. [[TruthInTelevision It's a common tactic of militaries the world over]], with some regimes (such as UsefulNotes/NaziGermany) being ''infamous'' for it.

That said, the "Justice" these rivals have in mind is more akin to a brutal beatdown... well, most of the time it ''is'' an actual brutal NoHoldsBarredBeatdown, supposed to culminate in the receiver's humiliation or death. Any attempt to get them to see the (all too obvious) truth, [[ThisIsUnforgivable show mercy]], or realize they're a step away from utterly ruining the receiver's life/committing murder will never succeed. It invariably takes the hero beating the rival, be it in a CookingDuel or GoodOldFisticuffs, and proving RightMakesMight for the poor deluded soul to realize they were wrong all along, sometimes even coming around and realizing that DefeatMeansFriendship.

Villains who claim that [[FreudianExcuse their bad past/circumstances led them to do this]] will likely make you realize that FreudianExcuseIsNoExcuse.

All too often, these guys [[UngratefulBastard refuse to see reason]]. They promise that they'll come back to kill the hero, and shove his "mercy" and offer of friendship down his wind pipe. It might take the arrival of a plot significant character to clear things up and hand out some EpiphanyTherapy to all involved.

This is not limited to the antagonist's side. God help you if that hero you've harmed has a PsychoSupporter. And all parties to a {{masquerade}}, good or bad, are often required to [[KilledToUpholdTheMasquerade kill any poor schmuck]] [[HeKnowsTooMuch who accidentally sees something he's not supposed to]].

This could be what stops something from being an "act of justice" instead of an "[[{{Revenge}} act of vengeance]]". May be used as part of CruelMercy. A common habit for LawfulStupid characters.

Intriguingly, while disproportionate can possibly mean [[RestrainedRevenge underdoing it]], you'll almost never see that happen.

[[AC:Other:]]
Contrast with {{Unishment}} (a punishment that isn't a punishment at all) and RestrainedRevenge (paying back a slight with retribution that is less severe than what was intended before rather than forgive the person in question). Expect the character dishing this out to [[RationalizingTheOverkill justify this no matter what anyone speaks against it.]] Expect someone (doesn't needs be the OnlySaneMan) to be DisappointedByTheMotive if the retribution is just ''that'' absurdly disproportional to the reason.
