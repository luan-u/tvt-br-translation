The writers have a villain, and they want to give that character some depth. The obvious solution is to PetTheDog. Unfortunately, that tends to make the character less scary, causing BadassDecay and VillainDecay.

Instead, writers may keep the villain (especially TheSociopath) just as vile as before, but reveal that they have a reason for being that way. The most popular one is the Freudian Excuse: the villain had an [[DarkAndTroubledPast abusive and particularly violent backstory]] (such as AbusiveParents, [[AllOfTheOtherReindeer being bullied by peers]], [[RapeAsBackstory being raped in the past]], etc.), making them insane and warping their perception on the universe, and that's why they're sociopathic {{Serial Killer}}s going on a RoaringRampageOfRevenge, or why they [[SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum want to destroy everything out of their misery]], or why they're {{Straw Nihilist}}s who adhere to TheSocialDarwinist philosophy that it's a CrapsackWorld where MightMakesRight. Sometimes, this is done for deliberate BadassDecay, but usually it isn't. The villain is as horrible as ever, only now the audience can look at them in a new way.

Unfortunately, just like a PetTheDog moment, the Freudian Excuse sometimes fails to give a villain any depth at all. If the villain is particularly evil, it can come across as an illogical and lame NonSequitur: "his [[AbusiveParents father]] beat him, and [[DisproportionateRetribution that's why he's an]] OmnicidalManiac." Even if the villain's crimes are proportionate, the writers have to strike a hard balance. Too much emphasis on the excuse, and it looks like they're attorneys justifying the villain. Too little, and it is a fallacious [[UsefulNotes/LogicalFallacies Appeal to Pity]] that looks like a ridiculously gratuitous scene of {{Wangst}}. However, this can in turn be highlighted in-story if the other characters point out that FreudianExcuseIsNoExcuse. In the case of the CompleteMonster, it fails to justify anything, merely explaining their origins and nothing more. It could even be used to make the character ''worse'', since they know how awful it is to be treated horribly yet inflict pain on others anyway while rejecting the possibility of ever getting over their trauma and changing their ways.

Most importantly, the Freudian Excuse does not involve the character growing or changing; it explains why they haven't changed, and in fact, often serves as a [[BeyondRedemption signal that they cannot and]] ''[[BeyondRedemption never will]]''. Bad writers often think that the excuse can substitute for CharacterDevelopment, but it does the exact opposite. Good writers know the excuse has limits, and watch them. If done well enough, it may lead the audience to CryForTheDevil or even straight-up turn a near-CompleteMonster into a WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds. A Freudian Excuse is often invoked to explain how someone who UsedToBeASweetKid became such a monster instead - again, much writerly skill is generally needed to pull this off and make it poignant rather than pathetic.

The excuse can be played with in many ways. One way is to use it to show how ''pathetic'' a villain is -- after the villain gives a BreakingSpeech, a hero's [[ShutUpHannibal classic rebuttal]] is "says the guy who became an EvilOverlord to work out his daddy issues." The second way is for the villain to [[DontYouDarePityMe sneer at the hero's pity for them]], even exploiting it in a fight. (Further, the villain is protesting far too much.) A third way is to simply present it as an ''explanation'' rather than a full excuse. Sometimes the author simply shows what warped the character into what they became without expecting the audience to feel any more sympathetic toward the character- a sort of psychological HowWeGotHere. And a ''fourth'' way is to use the Freudian Excuse as a justification for a HeelFaceTurn; if the villain gets treatment he no longer has any reason to be evil and may pay the heroes back out of gratitude.

Many CrimeAndPunishmentSeries (and DarkerAndEdgier {{superhero}} comics) are notorious for WriterOnBoard stories [[DeconstructedTrope deconstructing]] the Freudian Excuse. At least once per storyline, there will be a slimy psychiatrist or [[AmoralAttorney defense attorney]] who declares that the [[SerialKiller Neck-Chopping Killer]] is merely a victim of circumstances, and it's the hero who should be locked away. These stories tend to end with said psychiatrist or defense attorney getting murdered by the killer, which is depicted as poetic {{Irony}}.

However, not all examples of Freudian Excuses have to involve evil or villainous characters. It can also be used to explain the neurotic behaviors of even heroic or otherwise neutral characters. And sometimes, the Freudian Excuse can work well in sympathizing with a character.

See FreudianExcuseIsNoExcuse for deconstructions of this trope, and FreudianExcuseDenial for one particular subversion.

'''Please note that the trope deals only with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence. Being raped or losing one's job or family as a fully formed adult is not a Freudian Excuse.'''
