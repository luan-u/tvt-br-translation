Jumping the Shark is the moment when an established LongRunner series changes in a significant manner, ranging from a contrived gimmick to a full {{Retool}}. This can be the result of circumstance, though it is more often a desperate attempt to [[WinBackTheCrowd overcome flagging ratings and/or attract new viewers]]. Unfortunately, it doesn't work; looking back, viewers realize that [[SelfFulfillingProphecy the change actually caused or hastened the show's demise]].

[[TropeNamers The expression comes from]] an episode of the TV series ''Series/HappyDays'' in which Fonzie, dressed in his trademark leather jacket, literally jumps over a shark while on waterskis -- a sharp break from the show's previous focus on "[[SliceOfLife everyday American life]] in the [=1950s=]." In hindsight, that was the moment where Fonzie started getting more focus, being {{Flanderized}} in the process into a superhuman, impossibly 'cool' dude. In short order, he [[SpotlightStealingSquad took over the entire show]]. Even those who liked Fonzie -- [[EnsembleDarkHorse and most did]] -- had to admit that ''Happy Days'' wasn't better with him as the main lead. It wasn't even in line with Fonzie's own character development: in a landmark earlier episode, he seriously injured himself while jumping his motorcycle for a televised stunt, admitting afterward that he was stupid to be so reckless. When he jumped over a shark, Fonzie [[AesopAmnesia seemingly forgot that important lesson]], and it was the first sign that ''Happy Days'' was going to abandon its premise in an effort to stay fresh. By the time ABC canceled ''Happy Days'' in 1984, it had become [[SeasonalRot a shell of its former self]], with several of the original cast gone, and was mainly notable for launching ''Series/MorkAndMindy'' through a PoorlyDisguisedPilot episode.

"Jumping the shark" has since entered common parlance to refer to the moment when a LongRunner work or franchise goes into unrecoverable decline. The term was originally coined in the mid-1980s by writer Jon Hein. Notably, it was only after ''Happy Days'' ended that anyone realised what the turning point had been; it's difficult to spot a shark-hurdle in real time. As Fonzie and his waterskis fade from cultural memory, "nuking the fridge" (named after an infamous scene in ''Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull'') may become the new term of art, but only the wording is new: the frustration and disappointment are as old as serialized media itself.[[note]]TV Tropes does not consider "Nuking the Fridge" a separate or well-defined concept from "Jumping the Shark" -- in fact, "Nuking the Fridge" as a separate trope ''and'' as a redirect to this trope is a member of the Administrivia/PermanentRedLinkClub because people kept trying to add it without being able to define it.[[/note]]

Jumping the shark can happen at any time in an established work's run. While it's often used in reference to the show's last gasp, a drastic change to stay on the air which doesn't work, some shows drag on for years after the turning point: ''Happy Days'' went on for seven more seasons after Fonzie's shark-jumping stunt, with other changes in cast and situations; it was just [[SeasonalRot really boring]]. It's also possible for a show to jump ''several'' sharks during its twilight years, leading to what we call SeasonalRot.

!!How to spot a shark jump

It's difficult to define a shark jump, especially given how commonly the term is used for [[DarthWiki/RuinedForever complaining about plot twists you don't like]]. But there are a lot of telltale signs, and if you see them, the show had better have some ''really'' good writers to make [[GrowingTheBeard it seem like a worthwhile decision]].

[[foldercontrol]]

[[folder:Cast Changes]]
* A [[PopularityPower popular character]] is [[PutOnABus removed from the show]] or even {{killed off| for real}}. The idea is to extract cheap EmotionalTorque by making everyone sad that such a great character has left. It happens often enough that it can lead to TheFireflyEffect on a character level -- viewers don't want to get emotionally invested in characters they like in case they get written out later. It's especially likely to alienate the audience if the method of removal seems [[DroppedABridgeOnHim unsatisfying]] or [[PutOnABusToHell mean-spirited]]. It most often happens with quiet, introverted, or relatively passive characters (usually TheHeart), which just makes it even meaner.
* A character becomes a gimmick. This can happen to an existing EnsembleDarkhorse like Fonzie, or it can be a new character ([[RememberTheNewGuy or not]]) who is introduced for this reason. The problem with gimmicky characters is that they [[SpotlightStealingSquad demand a lot of attention]], usually at the expense of existing character dynamics. It's especially problematic if the new character [[ReplacementScrappy replaces a previous one]] -- and, going back to the above point, if they're replacing a relatively passive character. The new character is usually TheCastShowoff and often HotterAndSexier.
* An actor leaves and a character needs to be replaced. Unfortunately, even if it's [[RealLifeWritesThePlot not the show's fault]] (''e.g.'' when the actor dies), it's very difficult to pull off and keep the audience engaged. You basically have three options: [[TheCharacterDiedWithHim kill off the character]] (which forces a significant {{retool}} if this character was instrumental to the show's success), go with TheOtherDarrin (same character, different actor), or go with a SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute (different actor, different character, same archetype).
* A [[CousinOliver child character]] is added to a cast of adults. It rarely works, because audiences can see through a cheap attempt at adding "cuteness". A particularly cruel version is where the cast's ''existing'' child characters are sidelined for the (younger and cuter) new kid.
* And the presence of Creator/TedMcGinley. Okay, that's not exactly fair, but Jon Hein noted his tendency to play characters like this and called him the "patron saint of shark-jumping" -- his appearance in a series spelled its doom. These days, he sometimes appears alongside invocations of the shark jump as a kind of LampshadeHanging.
[[/folder]]

[[folder:Character Development]]
* [[TheScrappy A generally-disliked character]] is given more focus and screentime, which sometimes [[RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap exonerates him through character development]], but more often turns him into a CreatorsPet. Even when viewers do like the character (e.g. the EnsembleDarkhorse), making them more prominent because [[WolverinePublicity the fans demand it]] rarely turns out well for the character ''or'' the show.
* An existing character evolves in a way that [[{{Flanderization}} flattens rather than enriches them]], or which [[CharacterDerailment contradicts prior depictions of said character]]. This can streamline a character in an appealing way, but more often it offends and alienates the fans.
* The OfficialCouple resolves their UnresolvedSexualTension too soon and [[ShippingBedDeath the shippers lose their emotional investment in the show]].
* The writers, trying to avoid the above, look for ways to delay the couple's hook-up. If not handled deftly, this annoys the shippers and replaces the romantic tension with frustration or disinterest.
* The protagonist degenerates into an InvincibleHero -- or worse, a FailureHero. There's just no tension anymore, as it's been pushed aside in favour of gawking at a character.
* A character [[AesopAmnesia forgets a valuable lesson they had learned in the past]], usually resulting in them having to learn the same lesson over and over again until the audience loses patience with them.
[[/folder]]

[[folder:Plot Development]]
* The show's premise is [[{{Retool}} radically altered]], such as having the cast change careers or move to a new location, especially when the cast doesn't seem to have the skills (or the financial resources) for such a move. A former top football quarterback could become a TV sports announcer, but a character working a SoulSuckingRetailJob at a clothes store for ten seasons isn't suddenly going to become a fashion executive in Paris in season 11.
** The new setting is an exotic, cool locale. Again, the less the move is justified in-universe, the more likely the audience is to reject it. If a MillionairePlayboy who is a superspy[=/=]TechBro moves to a new mansion in the French Riviera, that's plausible; but if four roommates from FlyoverCountry with regular jobs do the same move, it's ludicrous.
* Conversely, a show which is based on a coherent story arc [[ArcFatigue fails to make changes that would resolve -- or even progress -- the story]]. This can happen from over-reliance on {{Filler}}, the ResetButton, or FailureIsTheOnlyOption. If the plot is based on a MythArc, dragging it out too long or [[KudzuPlot piling plot thread upon plot thread]] without resolution may lead to fans getting the impression that [[TheChrisCarterEffect the writers are just making it up as they go along]] and subsequently tuning out.
* The show experiences MoodWhiplash and becomes unbelievable and unrelatable. This often happens when ExecutiveMeddling demands that the show become DarkerAndEdgier or LighterAndSofter. Abrupt changes to the SlidingScaleOfVillainThreat also alienate the fanbase -- you can't just go from trying to save the beloved corner shop to trying to save the entire galaxy.
* One of the writers [[WriterOnBoard puts too much of themselves into the show]]. They may use it as a vehicle to [[AuthorTract preach their personal beliefs]] in a [[{{Anvilicious}} heavy-handed manner]], or to indulge [[AuthorAppeal personal kinks]] which the audience [[{{Squick}} does not share]]. This usually leads to {{Author Filibuster}}s, {{Straw Character}}s, IssueDrift, and GoingCosmic.
* A cute baby is [[CompetenceZone added to an otherwise-adult cast]], resulting in the ill-suited addition of childish themes and [[CutenessProximity endless baby talk]] from characters who were once intelligent adults.
* The plot ''is'' resolved -- but with twists or {{retcon}}s which are inconsistent with the overall narrative, the resolution is [[AssPull poorly set up]], or the ending is just plain stupid.
* The show reaches its SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome and has nowhere to go but down. This can also apply when a soon-to-be-canceled show delivers its GrandFinale and then is UnCanceled.
* A major plot point is resolved [[YoYoPlotPoint and then unresolved]] over and over again. It's particularly acute when the OfficialCouple (or BetaCouple) is constantly breaking up and getting back together, to the point where it aggravates not only the audience but the other characters.
* Obvious lack of investment in the production. This can be an overreliance on [[StrictlyFormula the show's formula]], an abundance of {{Bottle Episode}}s, {{Recycled Script}}s, and blatant {{Series Continuity Error}}s. Alternatively, the show goes off the rails and starts getting ''really'' weird and off-beat, especially after it's [[ItsBeenDone exhausted the formula]] (like how ''Happy Days'' introduced aliens). Either way, it breaks the WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief.
* TooBleakStoppedCaring: Too much {{Angst}} (or worse, {{Wangst}}), makes the audience lose sympathy for the characters and tune out.
* A RomanceArc takes over a series that wasn't about relationships, becoming a RomanticPlotTumor.
* The FranchiseOriginalSin becomes too obvious to ignore.
* The writer starts [[DeathIsCheap resurrecting dead characters]], [[CloningGambit cloning characters]], exploring {{Alternate Universe}}s, {{retcon}}ning past plot points (possibly via AllJustADream), adding TimeTravel to the story, and otherwise giving continuity the finger. See OpeningACanOfClones for why this tends to wreck a show.
[[/folder]]

[[folder:Gimmicks]]
* The tone becomes DenserAndWackier, which can be especially glaring if the show started with a serious tone.
* The show starts relying too much on [[SpecialGuest "special guest stars"]], especially celebrities [[AsHimself playing themselves]], which wreck the verisimilitude of the show. An episode might even turn into a NonActorVehicle.
* Graphical gimmicks such as [=3D=] are used to shore up failing character development. In video games, this can be a ScrappyMechanic. In animated series, this can be an ArtShift that tries to be "cutting-edge" but usually goes the opposite direction.
* TheMovie is released, and the show's creativity level starts to drop. One doesn't necessarily cause the other, but smart executives usually time the release of the film at the peak of the show's popularity, so it's all downhill from there.
* A gimmick is ''dropped'' -- if it existed since the beginning and was endearing or otherwise core to the show's appeal.
* The show starts to tell instead of show -- for example, characters get promoted to a higher rank to give the illusion of progress, but we don't see any reason why [[InformedAttribute they should be promoted]].
* A MusicalEpisode or a ClipShow.
* The show tries too hard to stay "current", [[LongRunnerTechMarchesOn even when it doesn't make any sense]], or when the writers are obviously {{two decades behind}} the times.
* The show tries to appeal to a more "mainstream" audience, only to lose its focus and [[ItsPopularNowItSucks alienate its original fans]].
* Appealing to the LowestCommonDenominator. This usually involves the introduction of lowbrow humor, {{Slapstick}}, gratitous extra {{Fanservice}} (the female leads enter a wet t-shirt contest or try to learn poledancing), or other forms of [[PolishTheTurd turd-polishing]]. It's most acute with {{Talk Show}}s, which might start off as intelligent and erudite but devolve into the daytime ratings king, the PointAndLaughShow where the typical line-up includes drug-addled RockStar, a has-been sex kitten talking her sex tape, and a homemaker-turned CamWhore.
* [[{{Sequelitis}} Too many sequels or spin-offs]], each one less creative than the last.
* BaitAndSwitchLesbians. It's remarkably easy for a show to generate cheap hype by teasing the possibility of an LGBT pairing. The executives seem to think that LGBT persons will watch anything that portrays one of them, regardless of quality, out of desperation for positive representation on television. They also think that men will watch [[GirlOnGirlIsHot anything with lesbians]]. They milk the relationship for "progressive" hype. And then, to keep the audience that ''wouldn't'' like to [[ButNotTooGay see that kind of thing]], they reveal that they're just friends, roommates, cousins, whatever.
[[/folder]]

[[folder:Behind the Scenes]]
* The show changes location. This is often unavoidable for LongRunners, as early seasons are shot somewhere random because they offer [[MoneyDearBoy tax incentives]], but as the show gets bigger and the actors want more opportunities, they inevitably have to move to [[HollywoodProvincialism Southern California]]. This often comes with a related gimmick, if the change [[TheMountainsOfIllinois can't be easily masked]] and the setting moves with the production.
* Non-American productions going for [[{{Americanization}} Hollywood]]. This means that whatever charm they may have had is surgically removed to appeal to the American audience, which is [[ViewersAreMorons not known for being particularly clever]]. Oddly, the only reason the show's producers even think to do this is because of a PeripheryDemographic ''in America'', who presumably appreciates the show for what it is, quirky foreignness and all.
* Similarly, American productions being tweaked to appeal to UsefulNotes/{{China}}. The Chinese market is a ''gigantic'' money maker for movies, but what China will allow to be shown in their cinema is [[BannedInChina very strict]]. This can cause script rewrites that [[WhatCouldHaveBeen vastly change what the movie could have been]], superfluous scenes and pointless extra characters to be used in Chinese marketing, and can even [[OvershadowedByControversy cause controversy that brings the whole movie down]] if the things done to appeal to China are offensive to Western audiences. It's made worse by how overt this can be, as the Chinese government only allows 34 international movie releases per year and has full control over release dates, advertising, and how many screenings it can get -- since competition is fierce studios are often willing to pander to desperate levels to get their movie past the bar.
* One of the cast members gets into an embarrassing real-life scandal. This makes the show [[OvershadowedByControversy less interesting than the scandal]]. If the accusation is ''really'' serious (''e.g.'' racism, DomesticAbuse, [[RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil sexual assault]]), no one will want anything to do with the show [[RoleEndingMisdemeanor until that cast member is erased from the show entirely]] -- which can't always be done cleanly.
* Change of timeslot. This is especially true if the show winds up on the other side of the {{Watershed}} and now has to worry about censorship (or lack thereof, if it's been moved to OtakuOClock). A ChannelHop can also cause a serious shift, especially if the new network has a smaller audience, or if it doesn't fit the new network's genre (leading to NetworkDecay). A move to the FridayNightDeathSlot is almost certainly the show's death knell.
* The original creator [[GodDoesNotOwnThisWorld is no longer in charge anymore]]. They may have left to work on other projects, they may have been fired or KickedUpstairs, they may have [[DiedDuringProduction died]], or they may have just [[CreatorsApathy stopped caring]]. Whatever the case, the creator can no longer micromanage his creation, and whoever is newly in charge will be keen to [[DependingOnTheWriter remake the show in their own vision]]. This, of course, presumes that the creator hasn't [[TorchTheFranchiseAndRun tried to sabotage it before leaving]].
* A main cast member becomes [[ProducedByCastMember a producer]]. This allows them to think of the show as "their show" and take total control of it. Their co-stars are often resentful of this, and it shows on screen.
* A real-life Hollywood couple is [[CoupleBomb cast as the lead couple]] and puts too much of themselves into the characters they play.
* An important role is given to [[{{Nepotism}} a relative or significant other]] of some key player behind the scenes, regardless of that person's competence or fitness for the role.
* The departure of the last remaining original cast member. While cast members leaving and being replaced often leads to a shark-jumping, this can be avoided if it's the right kind of show. But when this particular cast member leaves, there's no denying it's the EndOfAnEra.
* The show gives in to outside pressure to change the material, either to make it DarkerAndEdgier (because people want to be fans of a "deep" show) or to tone it down at the behest of the MoralGuardians, whose demands tend to be even ''less'' reasonable (and aren't even based on [[CowboyBebopAtHisComputer research]]).
* Governmental institutions sign in laws that outright ban the use of well-liked or even defining elements of the show (if the work isn't banned outright). It also happens to foreign works that try to appeal to audience living under said governments.
* The show becomes ''too'' successful and can now [[CashCowFranchise sell by itself]], which can lead to a collapse in motivation or effort from the creators, or the creators getting ProtectionFromEditors and ignoring advice on improving the show from outside.
* The show has multiple creators with different creative visions, who start [[ArmedWithCanon fighting over whose canon is better]] while forgetting to make stories worth watching.
* A PromotedFanboy gains control and the show becomes susceptible to personal over-indulgences in {{Mythology Gag}}s, {{Internal Homage}}s, {{Shout Out}}s, {{Actor Allusion}}s, FanWank, and other love letters to the show.
* A [[UsefulNotes/TVStrikes writer's strike]] hits. Replacement writers are by definition scabs and can rarely come up with something that can measure up to the regulars' work. This also leads to things like excessive {{Bottle Episode}}s in a desperate attempt to wait out the strike.
* TechnologyMarchesOn in a way that fundamentally changes production while a show tries to continue in the new format as though nothing ever happened. A generation of TV shows had their best years in black and white, switched to color, and often continued right up to UsefulNotes/TheRuralPurge, but the most memorable and best-received era is the black-and-white era.
