Sometimes, even LaserGuidedKarma misses its target.

The character has done a number of things that deserve a karmic comeuppance, most importantly things that caused harm to the innocent. But when the time comes for the hammer to fall, that's not what happens. At least, not on them. They ''don’t'' get what they deserve. Instead, they get away scot-free. They are EasilyForgiven, maybe even praised, and even elected president. And they might even have ''reversed'' the HumiliationConga that was being planned for them. Worst comes to worst, TheBadGuyWins and a stolen happy ending takes place at the expense of the [[KarmicMisfire hapless victim]] who [[NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished may be punished in the guilty character's place]].

This is it. This is all there is to the story. The show is over. The book is finished. The author isn't going to write any more. The WordOfGod has been spoken. Karma is out to lunch. The villain has become a [[TitleDrop Karma Houdini]].

Predictably, it is often shocking or downright ''upsetting'' to see such scoundrels dodge [[CantGetAwayWithNothing instant karmic punishment]] and come out triumphant in the end. But as frustrating as it is, [[TropesAreTools it does not necessarily make the story "worse" as long as it doesn't feel forced, contrived, or even shortsighted.]] Regardless, this trope runs the high risk of leaving the audience's thirst for emotional catharsis unsatiated, especially when they've become so invested in seeing the villain they've projected their hate onto get their full commupance that may or may not come by the end. And when it doesn't, you can expect them to complain about it and clamor for a sequel where the villain ''does'' get their comeuppance -- or alternatively, they'll try to satisfy their frustratingly unfulfilled desire for retribution by [[RevengeFic writing their own]].

There can be a number of reasons for this trope. Sometimes, the story is going for a DownerEnding in which the villains escape justice for their crimes. Other times, the creators overlook relatively minor offenders, whether due to not considering their actions worthy of punishment or not having the time to see them get their comeuppance within the story. Still other times, it may not be possible to exact retribution on the characters who ends up becoming Karma Houdinis. It could be that they're too powerful to be subject to retribution- any EldritchAbomination in a horror story is likely to be this, as even if they don't outright win, they are so beyond mortal comprehension that the best the protagonists can hope for is to simply escape them. Or it could be that there's no way to legally judge them because they are above the law in some way, and the protagonists are not willing to risk it all for some vigilante justice.

Compare ButtMonkey, for which a character ends up having many disproportionately bad things happen to them throughout the story (and may also technically qualify for this trope, as hard as that sounds). The extreme counterpart of the former trope, CosmicPlaything, can be considered this trope's polar {{opposite|Tropes}}. Also compare with NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished, where the good guy suffers as a result of doing the right thing.

Contrast the aforementioned LaserGuidedKarma, when the villain's comeuppance hits at an incredibly opportune moment and is directly traceable to their transgression; KarmaHoudiniWarranty, when the comeuppance only happens in a sequel; and KarmicDeath, when the comeuppance leads to the villain's death. Also see IdiotHoudini, when a person is forever protected from the results of their stupidity.

Note that a character doesn't necessarily need to be a full-time villain to qualify for this trope. They may simply end up [[KickTheDog doing unnecessarily hurtful things]], yet not suffer the repercussions. (In contrast, when someone ''is'' too evil to kill off, but may suffer other consequences, see JokerImmunity.)

Note also: The work usually must be completed for a character to qualify as this trope. Only if there are no more opportunities for LaserGuidedKarma to strike can a character be said to have successfully avoided any consequences for their actions. Exceptions may be made in cases where StatusQuoIsGod,[[note]]which is why you should not add this trope to the ThisImageIsNotAnExample index[[/note]] or when a character can be said to have permanently escaped, e.g. they died peacefully in their sleep at an old age. [[{{Hell}} And sometimes even that’s not enough.]] (Unless they ''somehow'' managed to get into {{Heaven}} and are gleefully rubbing their current state in your face). Otherwise, resist the urge to put it on an ongoing work's page.

Don't mistake a lack of direct karma for this trope. If a character, for example, murders someone and never gets caught, but [[BoltOfDivineRetribution a freak lightning strike kills them]], [[KarmicDeath they've still gotten their comeuppance even though the lightning had no connection to their crime]]. Think of the writer as God, with the power to punish or not punish a character who does evil.

[[JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant Not to be confused with]] a literal Houdini-style escape by the villain to avoid justice, that's VillainExitStageLeft, although the two certainly can (and often do) overlap.

!! Note to Editors

To avoid this trope from being misused, if even just one bad or horrible thing happens to a villainous character or nasty jerk and/or if it is possible to defeat or kill them in a video game (like, for example, a fighting game if they are a playable character and/or the end boss), then they do not qualify for this trope. Karma Houdinis must have ABSOLUTELY nothing bad to ever happen to them (and for it to be impossible to attack and defeat them in a video game (see TheUnfought) to qualify for this trope.
