Sometimes, [[LightIsGood The Forces of Light and Goodness]] get a [[TheUnfettered little bit]] [[GoneHorriblyRight too hardcore]]. In a deadly combination of WellIntentionedExtremist, TheFundamentalist, MoralMyopia, and sometimes HeWhoFightsMonsters, they [[BlackAndWhiteInsanity get blinded]] by themselves and [[VisionaryVillain their ideals]], and this extreme becomes tyrannical [[MoralSociopathy sociopathy]]. It's not The Forces of Darkness's fault, but they are laughing their asses off and feel so satisfied knowing that they were ''right''.

Usually, the Knight Templar's primary step (or objective) to their perceived "{{utopia|JustifiesTheMeans}}" is to get rid of that pesky "[[TheEvilsOfFreeWill free will]]" thing that is the cause of crime and evil. Many Knights Templar are [[PayEvilUntoEvil utterly merciless]] in dealing with those whom they consider evil, and are prone to [[AllCrimesAreEqual consider all crimes to be equal]]. The lightest offenses, maybe even [[ArsonMurderAndJaywalking jaywalking]] are met with [[DisproportionateRetribution punishments such as full imprisonment, death, brainwashing, or eternal torture]]. If you're in a story like this, don't jaywalk, or even ''{{th|ought crime}}ink'' about jaywalking. And may heaven help you if you happen to [[PunishedForSympathy show any mercy or pity]] for a "wrongdoer." Sometimes even simply being an annoying [[{{Jerkass}} jerk]] can earn someone a Knight Templar's wrath, whether [[JerkWithAHeartOfGold they had a hidden heart]] or not.

It's important to note that despite being ''villainous'' within the context of the story, Knights Templar fully believe that they are on the side of righteousness [[TheFettered and draw strength from it]] and that their opponents are not. Trying to reason with one isn't much good either, because many Knight Templar types believe that [[WithUsOrAgainstUs if you're not with them, you're against them]]. Invoking actual goodness and decency will have no effect, besides making Knights Templar hate you and [[{{Demonization}} demonize]] your cause as the work of [[{{Satan}} The Devil]]. After all, they are certain that only ''their'' cause is noble, and anyone who stands in the way is at best a deluded fool who needs to be "corrected", or at worst an evildoer who needs to die. And doing so is not even DirtyBusiness (except sometimes, for how much it makes ''[[ItsAllAboutMe them]]'' suffer, having to hand out all this justice). Indeed, it may take them a while to [[EvilCannotComprehendGood realize that a person with sense and good will really opposes them]]; the [[IncorruptiblePurePureness righteousness]] of their cause -- and their own selves -- is self-evident to them. One of the few ways to actually change a Knight Templar's mind is to kick their ass down to the ground. This is because most are convinced that MightMakesRight, and that since they are good they only kill the evil, so if you beat them but don't kill them, you are good too. They won't necessarily join you, but with a little luck their mild concussion will stop them fighting for long enough to listen to your side of the story, unless of course, they conclude they're still ''inherently'' superior and that [[CombatPragmatist you]] only beat them because [[SoreLoser you called upon the powers of darkness to cheat]].

The Knight Templar is often the ultimate incarnation of LightIsNotGood, and in series where DarkIsNotEvil, you can count on this guy being the villain who believes that the "dark" characters are evil and must be destroyed (though a villain with powers of darkness can still be this if they believe themselves to be heroic). If a Knight Templar is ''[[VillainProtagonist not]]'' [[VillainProtagonist the antagonist of the story]], expect to see WhatTheHellHero and/or NotSoDifferentRemark come into play at least once. If not, then they are a DesignatedHero. If they are still nominally good, expect them to be a HeroAntagonist.

Note that not all Knights Templar are explicitly evil from the beginning. Many an AntiHero will start by [[PayEvilUntoEvil Paying Evil Unto Evil]], and when they're not busting ass, are perfectly decent people. They may even overlook small fallacies and be classed on the good guy roster. These guys are often concerned that they run the risk of falling into HeWhoFightsMonsters and become this trope.

Many Knights Templar can be found in the ranks of the CorruptChurch, the ChurchMilitant, or the PathOfInspiration: expect them to be screaming that they are HolierThanThou and we should all "{{Burn|TheWitch}} TheHeretic!" Even a SaintlyChurch can have one of these as a {{foil}} for the {{Good Shepherd}}s. If the ''deity'' behind one of these churches is one of these, on the other hand, you've got problems -- count on an EasyRoadToHell due to them being so impossibly strict that few (if any) of the mortals under them can live up to their standards of morality.

A Knight Templar in a fantasy setting is usually a PrinciplesZealot, religious or otherwise. In a modern or Sci-Fi setting, the Knight Templar is just as likely to be a TotalitarianUtilitarian instead. In either case, they're likely to be a bigot who hardly qualifies as {{noble|Bigot}}, but might be {{troubled|SympatheticBigot}} by their own BlackAndWhiteInsanity. Sometimes, the Knight Templar is [[TheComputerIsYourFriend an artificially intelligent computer]] that took its instructions to "protect humanity" [[ZerothLawRebellion a bit too far]]. Prone to the [[BreakThemByTalking Breaking Speech]] and/or MotiveRant about how the heroes going up against them are evil and they themselves the good guys.

Another thing to keep in mind is that while Knights Templar will insist that they're good guys, even the ones that are practically villains, they often aren't completely ignorant of the pain they cause; they simply consider it to be acceptable collateral damage, or regret the means they "must" use to achieve their ends. If the Knight Templar fails to see ''any'' wrong in their actions, then you're dealing with a variant known as the TautologicalTemplar, who is so convinced that they're doing the right thing that they can't even fathom the idea that anything they do might be questionable or hurting others. It can get to the point where their rebuttal to anyone that tries to [[WhatTheHellHero call them out]] will basically amount to "My actions are good because ''[[InsaneTrollLogic I know]]'' [[TautologicalTemplar I am good and can't possibly be bad, and furthermore, you oppose me because you're bad!"]]

Very prone to ItsAllAboutMe, thus, expect their {{pride}} on being the only righteous ones to bring them down. Many Templars are LawfulNeutral or LawfulEvil, but the most egomaniacal and self-centered ones are NeutralEvil (though they'll never admit it), and the AnimalWrongsGroup version is ChaoticEvil.

More often than not, this kind of villain views themselves as NecessarilyEvil.

See also KnightTemplarParent, KnightTemplarBigBrother, and LawfulEvil. Those who will ''really'' do anything for their beliefs count among TheUnfettered. A mild, comedic version is the LordErrorProne. Blind devotion to AllCrimesAreEqual without the religious zealotry falls under LawfulStupid.

Can even overlap with PayEvilUntoEvil and HeWhoFightsMonsters.

Contrast with CardCarryingVillain, a villain who is fully aware of their evil nature and proudly embraces it. A Knight Templar can become this if they have a HeelRealization and [[IgnoredEpiphany decide to keep being a villain anyway]]. Compare and contrast with the KnightInSourArmor, who is what happens when a LawfulGood character [[ToBeLawfulOrGood chooses to err]] on the side of Good instead of erring towards Law; and ObliviouslyEvil, where the villain is so thoroughly convinced of their own righteousness that the idea that they're doing anything wrong doesn't even occur to them without external output, and upon having the consequences of their actions pointed out to them, will either make a HeelFaceTurn or become a Knight Templar and continue believing that their actions are right and the dissenter is wrong.

Compare/contrast KnightErrant. Contrast GoodIsNotNice for when a character is genuinely on the side of good but may rub other characters or the audience the wrong way. ''Not'' related to BloodKnight. Also compare and contrast with NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist, who uses fallacious claims of altruism to veil and rationalize entirely ''un''-altruistic motivations for committing their atrocities.

Not to be confused with TropeNamer UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar, who varied between fitting and defying this trope and were founded with the intention of protecting pilgrims. Due to the controversial nature of this trope, Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease
