The light twin of DarkerAndEdgier, when something is {{Tone Shift}}ed to be more family friendly and frothy than the original source. This can either happen to a show over time, or it can be the result of deliberate {{Executive Meddling}}. It could be a deliberate throwback to a pre-{{Cerebus Syndrome}} incarnation. Thus, a Lighter And Softer reboot may often follow an incarnation which made a point of being Darker and Edgier. Finally, if an adult or more serious TV show or movie has a spin-off aimed at children, this can be the result. Just like its brother extreme, Lighter and Softer can leave just as bad of a taste in longtime fans' mouths as Darker and Edgier if handled poorly.

At its most extreme it can [[CharacterDerailment turn]] a previously vibrant cast into {{Flat Character}}s and remove a lot of the show's appeal or even cause fans to abandon the work entirely. If it shoehorns BlackAndWhiteMorality into the work and makes everyone clear heroes and villains, then expect people to complain about the loss of subtlety in the setting, or feel like the writers are talking down to them.

In music, this may result in an artist merely recording a SurprisinglyGentleSong, or it could lead to the artist having a complete GenreShift to a lighter genre.

Often found alongside DenserAndWackier (when the work is made sillier and more gag-oriented than what came before), YoungerAndHipper (retooling a work so that the characters are younger to appeal to younger demographics) and KinderAndCleaner (where profanity is toned down if not removed outright). Also often signaled by an increase in [[{{Slapstick}} wacky humor]].

Just like with DarkerAndEdgier, please keep in mind that Administrivia/TropesAreTools. When something is lighter and softer than its initial source material, it doesn't mean it's automatically worse. It usually depends on who creates/writes said material as well as how subtly they make the transition. ExecutiveMeddling may of course be at fault; "We gotta appeal to the kids!" But other reasons include trying to be more mainstream, to change an unpopular run, to appeal to another demographic, to recognize and dispel TooBleakStoppedCaring etc. The Lighter And Softer run can end up being positively remembered for years to come. It just depends on who's behind the product and how they execute it.

Compare {{Bowdlerise}} (where a work is edited to remove material that can be considered questionable), {{Disneyfication}} (making a story more suitable for children by toning down the darker elements), MenaceDecay (where a bratty child character becomes less of a troublemaker over time), BadassDecay (where audiences see a cool character as becoming not as impressive and formidable as they used to be), ReverseCerebusSyndrome (where an initially dark work becomes lighter in tone over time), SugarWiki/{{WAFF}} (when a work's whole purpose is to appeal to the audience by being cute and endearing), AdaptationalAngstDowngrade (where an adaptation changes a character's backstory to remove the tragic parts), TamerAndChaster (where a work reduces the amount of nudity and sexual content) and PacifiedAdaptation (where the adaptation has less violence).

Contrast DarkerAndEdgier (where a work is changed to be darker and more serious in tone), BloodierAndGorier (where the work features more graphic violence than usual), CerebusSyndrome (where a work defaults to becoming darker in tone over time), AdaptationalAngstUpgrade (where an adaptation alters a character's history so their life is more miserable than it was in the source material) and HotterAndSexier (where a work increases the amount of nudity and sexual content).
