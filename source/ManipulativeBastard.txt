While TheChessmaster is the master manipulator of events, the Manipulative Bastard is the master manipulator of people, in essence, a character who manipulates others through their emotions, perspectives, psychologies and any other way they can get them dancing to their tune. This is the person who gets off on playing head/mind games -- clever and dangerous and lacking comedic overtones [[ComedicSociopathy (usu]][[BlackComedy ally)]]. They always have [[ThePlan a plan ready]], but rather than do any work, the Manipulative Bastard prefers to play on other characters' emotions and mental states and then watch the victims destroy themselves as they waste their energy on fighting against [[WindmillPolitical fake dangers]] or [[LetsYouAndHimFight their friends]].

In many cases the Manipulative Bastard personally is [[TheStoic rarely emotional]] and seldom burdened by notions such as empathy, yet is all too willing to [[HorribleJudgeOfCharacter abuse it in others]]. The Bastard is [[LackOfEmpathy unmoved by the pain of others]], if not [[{{Sadist}} actively basking in it]]. Thus the frequent association of how someone who does manipulative bastardry too often can come across as a [[TheSociopath sociopath]]. After all, too many PetTheDog moments may lead this character to [[BecomingTheMask become the mask]] and care about the people they previously saw as playthings.

Like Chessmasters, Manipulative Bastards will have some larger scheme in mind but tend to lose sight of it more easily and simply enjoy the control they have over their peers. A highly-focused/ambitious Manipulative Bastard is scary indeed; not only achieving their goal, but then ensuring permanent supremacy by destroying the souls of everyone they used to get there. A hell of a lot of HeroicWillpower, and often [[ShootTheDog Shooting the Dog]] is required to topple this character.

While this character type seems inherently villainous, many of them are at least nominally on the heroes' side. A cunning branch of the AntiHero family sports this trope and many a [[PragmaticHero pragmatic]] and/or GuileHero uses many of the same tricks. Indeed, TheTrickster may also overlap into Manipulative Bastard territory. The hero will probably survive a relationship with this character, but their [[EtTuBrute trust in people will not]].

Manipulative Bastards often fall into the KarmaHoudini trope -- after all, [[MoreThanMindControl they never "forced"]] anybody [[MurderBySuicide to do anything]]... which leads the audience to scream, "Why do you keep falling for this?" at the other characters.

Different methods of Manipulative Bastardry exist, depending on these characters' favorite tricks to manipulate people:
* TheVamp, the FemmeFatale, and TheCasanova mainly use their devastating powers of seduction.
* The PsychoPsychologist, who uses their [[MasterOfAll professional training and education]] in the workings of human nature to masterfully manipulate people.
* TheCharmer relies on general charisma.
* The [[TheSpock coldly analytical character]], user of the tricks of PsychologicalCombat, who pins the heroes' [[FlawExploitation weaknesses]] in one assessing glance and then [[BreakThemByTalking hits all their sore spots to devastating effect]].
* The BunnyEarsLawyer and other characters who use their ObfuscatingStupidity to mask and distract from their manipulations.
* The ConMan who lies and builds elaborate tricks professionally.
* The [[ConsummateLiar great liar]] who uses {{Sarcastic Confession}}s, {{False Reassurance}}s, and the MotivationalLie to dissimulate the truth.
* The SatanicArchetype, a [[DealWithTheDevil tempter]] who [[TheCorrupter takes advantage of people's worst flaws and desires]] in order to make themselves give up into them.
* The HighSchoolHustler: Expert in [[ZanyScheme Zany Schemes]], charming people into getting what they want, and remaining sympathetic while doing so.
* Certain EvilMatriarch[=/=]MyBelovedSmother types will use copious amounts of guilt tripping to ensure that their "loved" ones dance to their tune.
* The last subtype is the ApparentlyPowerlessPuppetmaster who is genuinely powerless and only has as much power as their opponents see fit to give them. To this end, they fake [[ObfuscatingStupidity stupidity]] or [[ObfuscatingInsanity insanity]] so that they can avoid being assassinated while still being able to manipulate events as they please.

Sometimes overlaps with DevilInPlainSight, but is often the "grown up" version, where the "look cute" fallback has become a fairly professional strategy. A Manipulative Bastard who mixes personal manipulation with more [[TheChessmaster complicated schemes]], more [[CriminalMindGames mind games]], and [[PsychoticSmirk sufficiently scary facial expressions]] -- and does it all with style -- can get promoted to MagnificentBastard. Compare ClockKing, who does the same thing with people's schedules instead of their emotions and/or minds. Manipulating people specifically to bring out their worst natures is the mark of TheCorrupter. May engage in a BattleOfWits, if anyone can match the Manipulative Bastard. For the much more heroic equivalent, see GuileHero. Not to be mistaken for a {{Troll}}, for whom their manipulations often don't have a purpose other than cruel amusement. See also OpportunisticBastard. Almost always overlaps with TheSocialExpert, though not all examples of that trope are manipulative.
