Someone cannot be harmed. Merely fighting them won't make them go away; if at all possible their defeat requires one to figure out ''how'', which is a legendary quest in and of itself. Usually the ability of the BigBad in sci-fi and fantasy settings, few heroes get this one. (Except in SuperHero series, with Franchise/{{Superman}} being the flagship example.)

Either one has to find their AchillesHeel, or else summon up a nuclear-bomb's worth of power in the last episode, either through ThePowerOfLove or KiManipulation or ''really'' heavy armaments (e.g. WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer) and hope for VillainDecay.

Sometimes a vaguely defined nigh-invulnerability is a way to make a hero [[StrongAsTheyNeedToBe only as tough as he needs to be to advance the plot]].

There's a number of ways one can have Nigh Invulnerability.

* ''[[SuperToughness Made of Diamond]]'': The power of the ImplacableMan and TheJuggernaut, [[NoSell nothing does anything to this being]]. [[Radio/TheFrantics Not a boot to the head]], or [[ImmuneToBullets a bullet to]] [[EyeScream the eye]], or [[DropTheHammer a sledgehammer to]] [[GroinAttack the groin]]. Sufficiently strong characters ''might'' be able to [[BlownAcrossTheRoom knock them through a wall or mountain]], but just one hit like that won't have any lasting effect. This is generally what people first think of when referring to this trope.
** Ironically, the title is a bit of a misnomer. While in real life diamonds have extreme hardness, they lack toughness and are brittle enough to be shattered by a hammer.
* ''Made of Air'': Going the opposite direction, there doesn't seem to be something to fight... but that "something" can fight ''you''. Either they have the power of SuperSmoke or {{Intangibility}} completely at will so that you can't attack them, or they may exist in some form that makes direct confrontation just not possible (an AstralProjection, for example, or just a plain old [[OurGhostsAreDifferent ghost]]).
* ''Made of Liquid'', AKA ''[[BlobMonster The Blob]]'': a common variant of this, when the character is made of some sort of fluid stuff that makes him tangible, but completely impervious to damage with bludgeoning or piercing weapons.
* ''[[RubberMan Made of Rubber]]'': Somewhere in between the last two, where most attacks just seem to bounce off with little to no effect to the victim.
* {{Kevlard}}: Similar to made of rubber, but with protective blubber instead. This is the form that X-Men's Blob benefits from. Unlike the former, usually they have some sort of weak spot.
* ''[[HealingFactor Regeneration/Regrowth]]'': They have the truly nasty tendency to recover from anything. [[OffWithHisHead Cut off their head]], [[LosingYourHead and it grows back]]. Cut them to pieces, and they [[PullingThemselvesTogether just reassemble themselves]]. [[KillItWithFire Burn them to ashes]], and mail them to Mexico, Norway, and Hong Kong, and they'll rebuild themselves FromASingleCell. Whether the character can survive being [[DisintegratorRay utterly atomised]] varies from fiction to fiction.
* ''[[SpareBodyParts External Repair/Spare Body Parts]]'': Like regeneration/regrowth, but external. Most common with [[EasilyDetachableRobotParts machines and]] {{cyborg}}s, but occasionally works for the undead or supernatural, and sometimes even a skilled {{Mad Doctor}} can pull this off with normal organisms. Chop off an arm? Meh, if it's too damaged to reattach, no big deal: it's replaceable. [[ChunkySalsaRule Blown into tiny chunks?]] That might take a little longer, but can sometimes still be fixed.
** BodyBackupDrive is the most extreme form of this, with a character being able to transfer their consciousness into a complete replacement ''body''. This new body may be modified as necessary, and possibly have some form of invulnerabilities themselves.
* ''[[RemoteBody The Proxy]]'': When a person makes use of other bodies or identities in order to conceal themselves and avoid direct contact, therefore reducing risk of injury/death. The proxy could take the form of a remote-control robot, [[ExpendableClone a cloned flesh puppet]], or a body double. If the proxy is encountered often enough, it can give the ''semblance'' of invulnerability.
** Alternatively, the person can be hit, but the proxy somehow takes all the damage instead.
* ''Multiple Bodies'': Similar to the above, this classic power of the HiveMind will render the death of one body [[Franchise/StarTrek irrelevant]]. At worst, to kill enemies with this ability will require killing ''every'' single part of him, since even one survivor may be able to recreate a whole new army of selves. However, if they have a HiveQueen, killing it may destroy the whole being.
* ''BodySurf'': Similar to Multiple Bodies and BodyBackupDrive above, but instead they [[DemonicPossession possess another living person]] to use for themselves, possibly transforming the body of the possessed into something related to the new owner. This may be even nastier than any of the above, especially when it has no limitations on whom they can possess, although usually [[KillTheHostBody destroying the body]] when the consciousness is still inside will kill both the possessed and the possessing entity permanently. ''Usually''.
* ''[[ResurrectiveImmortality Resurrection]]'': You technically ''can'' kill them, but the problem is that they don't ''stay dead''. Just pray that they don't have [[AdaptiveAbility the ability to adapt to whatever that managed to kill them before such that]] ItOnlyWorksOnce, and/or unlimited amount of extra life.
** ''[[BornAgainImmortality Rebirth]]'': Related to above, except when killed, they'll be reborn as an infant. Only applies if the character retains their memories/personality from their prior life, and probably will want you dead for killing them the first time around.
* ''[[FeelNoPain No Pain]]'': While you can technically damage them, their lack of pain receptors means that they will just keep coming. Very much DependingOnTheWriter, while a punch to the face will usually be ignored, chopping off a limb will presumably limit anyone's mobility regardless, though some authors raise this ability to superhuman levels.
** ''[[YouCantKillWhatsAlreadyDead No Pain for the Undead]]'': Lack of pain is justified because the character is a member of the living dead. This usually means that even severe organ damage can just be ignored, though even such characters [[ChunkySalsaRule tend to have limits]] in how far this can be pushed.
* ''Extreme Luck'': You don't need to be invincible when you never get hit.
** ''[[BornLucky Dumb Luck/Crazy Luck]]'': The clumsy hero/heroine can dodge everything just because of extreme luck. HilarityEnsues when the character is a MilesGloriosus who ''believes'' they are [[SuperToughness Made of Diamond]] but are actually this, or the {{Cloudcuckoolander}} leisurely strolls through BulletHell.
** ''[[BeyondTheImpossible Impossibly Good Luck]]'': They charge headlong at a machine gun, and win. Often paired with TheDeterminator- not all of the bullets miss, [[OnlyAFleshWound just the lethal ones]]. Expect an OhCrap moment when paired with TheBerserker. Also the constant disappointment of a chronic DeathSeeker.
** ''[[WindsOfDestinyChange Making Their Own Luck]]'': Some characters literally have luck on their side, in the form of [[FormulaicMagic crunching the numbers]], [[PsychicPowers only seeming to be relying on luck]], [[PalsWithJesus having a friendship with the one setting the odds]] or [[RealityWarper actually changing them themselves]].
* ''[[RealityWarper Reality-Warping]]'': They don't want to be hurt, so you can't hurt them. Simple as that.
** ''[[OurGodsAreDifferent God]]'': Face it. Sometimes you [[CompleteImmortality CAN'T]] [[KillTheGod kill a god]]. It's physically and theologically impossible. However [[TakesOneToKillOne other gods can sometimes kill gods]], so they do technically fit the "nigh" part.
** ''Divine Protection'': The character itself is not a god, but can survive anything due to intervention of a favorable god/guardian angel/spirit of parent that has been [[AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence 'struck down and become more powerful than you can possibly imagine']].
** ''Can Only Kill Part of Him'': FightingAShadow. Basically the whatsit that you were fighting was just its... "representation" in the same world. Killing its body in this dimensional plane is a mild setback... if at all, as it can grow that back very quickly or replace it. Technically not that different from [[BackFromTheDead Resurrection]] from the mortals' point of view, but distinct in that the actual entity never died- only their current physical manifestation. Usually applies to gods, demons, and perhaps [[EldritchAbomination Cosmic Horror]].

A combination of limited super-toughness, super-pain tolerance and regeneration is a popular [[RequiredSecondaryPowers power set]] to render a character effectively nigh-invulnerable while still being shown to suffer temporary pain and injury in a way that gives recognisable stakes to physical threats, even if we know they won't be fatal.

The PhysicalGod, ImplacableMan, TheJuggernaut, BlobMonster, IronButtMonkey, TheChewToy, and anything MadeOfIndestructium all probably have some form of Nigh Invulnerability.

Compare of course {{Immortality}}, for the ways in which characters cannot die. Contrast MadeOfIron, where no explanation is given for an individual's incredible resilience. See also ImmortalLifeIsCheap, which applies to such cases as Multiple Bodies or Regeneration; and {{Trainstopping}} which tends to have this as a requirement. When someone is invulnerable to literally ''everything'', then it becomes CompleteImmortality.
