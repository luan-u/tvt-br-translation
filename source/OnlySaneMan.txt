When there is a group of characters who are all just totally weird, either in general or in a particular scenario, the Only Sane Man is the only one who, well, isn't.

Picture this: Alice is the StupidEvil PsychoForHire, Bob is a {{Cloudcuckoolander}}, Henry is an EmptyShell, Charlotte is a ChaoticStupid [[ThePrankster prankster]], Karl is an ExtremeDoormat who's StupidGood, Daniel is Charlotte's AnnoyingYoungerSibling, Emily is a [[JerkWithAHeartOfJerk shallow]] {{sociopath}}, Maria often RhymesOnADime, Franklin is a MadScientist, Gardenia is a LawfulStupid {{Fundamentalist}}, Jacob thinks [[WindmillCrusader he's a hero on a grand quest]], and Lily is a MadArtist who's obsessed with her [[{{WaxMuseumMorgue}} wax "statues."]] Looks like your standard DysfunctionJunction. But then you have Isaac. Isaac is actually a very well-adjusted individual. He reacts with appropriate horror to things like Alice's finger and eyeball collection, Gardenia's tendency to attack anyone not believing in her religion, Franklin's experiments to revive the dead with science, and the crimes against nature that Franklin calls pets. Or reacts with either annoyance or bewilderment to things like Bob's [[InsaneTrollLogic warped logic]], Karl's HonorBeforeReason mindset (honor being always thought first in his case), Maria's insistence to rhyme all the time, and Jacob's [[HeroicWannabe delusions of being a hero]]. Isaac is the Only Sane Man in the room.

The other variant is where the other characters aren't ''always'' that weird, but everyone save one character is acting weird in a particular situation. For example, they might regard something absurd as SeriousBusiness, with the Only Sane Man the only one who notices how crazy that is.

This latter variant also includes a standard comedy piece: something absolutely insane [[NoMereWindmill is going on]], but only one person notices (or cares). There are usually three stages, with a rough correspondence to the FiveStagesOfGrief: Bewilderment (Shock and Anger), trying to get others to see or admit the weirdness (Bargaining and Denial), and [[DeadpanSnarker bitter sarcasm]] (Acceptance).

In the more extreme cases, the poor soul may be trapped in a WorldGoneMad and/or wind up GivingUpOnLogic in frustration. Sometimes, though, they are NotSoAboveItAll. A character may also ''think'' of themselves as the Only Sane Man without proper justification.

A TooDumbToFool character may be the Only Sane Man, although he is likely to be less worked up about the failures of others to see than in most cases.

The Only Sane Man is [[TheReliableOne often relied upon]] as the OnlySaneEmployee. This character often ends up a KnightInSourArmor. For a more horrific version, see ThroughTheEyesOfMadness. For the sci-fi version, the IgnoredExpert is your go-to guy. The comedy version will often end up being either a ButtMonkey or a ChewToy. If all the other characters are otherwise sane, and really should see something, but only one guy does, he's an EinsteinSue. See also CassandraTruth, SurroundedByIdiots, and SurroundedBySmartPeople; contrast with the UnfazedEveryman. May temporarily overlap with WhatTheHellHero.

If several characters take turns being the Only Sane Man, they're playing with a SanityBall. If it's a two-person show, with one person playing the Only Sane Man to the other's wackiness, it's a StraightManAndWiseGuy scenario. This trope is the savvy half of a SavvyGuyEnergeticGirl duo, one third of a ComicTrio, and part of the FourManBand. If they're only later proven right, it may be TheDissenterIsAlwaysRight.

Usually, but not always, a CastFullOfCrazy contains an Only Sane Man. Usually, he's prone to SanitySlippage. Sometimes, he's OnlySaneByComparison, in which he's pretty crazy himself but not ''as'' crazy as the rest of his cohorts.

TheWonka may well feel like this (or be this!) in a world that doesn't follow his thinking. Insanity is, after all, in the eye of the beholder, and TheWonka often has quite valid points.
