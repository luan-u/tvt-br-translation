Maybe your character was TheCape, but [[FallenHero fell on bad times]]. Maybe he was an AntiHero who made a mistake and [[JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope went flying off the slippery slope]]. They could even be a VillainProtagonist or AntiVillain who is interested in redemption, either because they've [[EvenEvilHasStandards kept their standards]], or because they've [[EvilVersusEvil been in conflict]] with an [[EvilerThanThou even worse villain]] and shown hints that there might be some good left in them after all. Whatever the case may be, the character is in a bad place but wants to do better, and they are granted one final chance to do so, usually in the form of a grand, nearly impossible task.

Maybe they're being asked to prevent TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt, or to cure TheVirus, or to stop the EvilOverlord. [[RedemptionEqualsDeath They may not be expected to live through this]], but if they can pull it off, no one can say that they haven't cleared their name, regained their honor, or insured an afterlife in good old FluffyCloudHeaven. (That said, you may wind up with a case of RedemptionEarnsLife instead.)

Sometimes done in a quieter way as CharacterDevelopment in a non-fantasy setting, where a character is looking to undo a past mistake or wrong to a love one that has haunted them or caused misery for people around them. Also known to happen in [[SportsStoryTropes Sports Movies]], where a character may see one last great year or performance as a redemption of their prior deeds or careers.

A SubTrope of TheHerosJourney and MustMakeAmends. Usually follows a HeelRealization, NiceJobBreakingItHero or someone saying WhatTheHellHero. Naturally, a staple of TheAtoner. An alternative to RedemptionEqualsDeath. Often a result of GoAndSinNoMore. Contrast ProtagonistJourneyToVillain and RedemptionFailure.
