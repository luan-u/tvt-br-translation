->''"That was necessary. The melting thing was... necessary."''
-->-- '''Creator/JoshScorcher''' on '''[[NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast Nightmare]]''' from ''VideoGame/MetroidFusion'', "Top Ten Scary Atmospheres"

Like the RuleOfCool and the RuleOfFunny, the Rule of Scary says that if it's creepy enough, it doesn't matter how illogical it is. All that matters is that it [[NightmareFuel creeps you out]].

'''Most effective formulas for scary:'''

* Mixing the paranormal or abnormal with the mundane and familiar. Even if the WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief remains intact, [[FantasticallyIndifferent blatantly scary things are easy to shrug off]] when they are happening in a completely [[SpaceWhaleAesop unrelatable situation]]. But when the same elements are placed side-by-side with familiar settings and elements, suddenly TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou. Even with flawless special effects a StarfishAlien in an EldritchLocation can be mere {{Narm}}, but invoking the UncannyValley with a HumanoidAbomination in an AbandonedHospital can be downright terrifying.
* [[LastNoteNightmare Ending on a note]] [[BreadEggsMilkSquick or element]] no sane person would. You'll find [[HumansAreTheRealMonsters humans are psychopathic]]. What is funny, notched up, is scary (and still kinda funny). Exempli gratia: [[Film/TheDarkKnight "How about a magic trick? I'm gonna make this pencil disappear..."]]
* Vividly showing (or describing) something scary which directly affects the human body. BodyHorror is a part of this, but this is not always BodyHorror. eg, ''Film/TheMatrix'' using humans as "living batteries", or some portrayals of viruses. ArtisticLicenseBiology is a major factor in this.
* [[NothingIsScarier Not showing anything]], and [[TheUnreveal leaving some things unexplained]]. This works on the (fairly reliable) premise that no expensive special effect or clever writing can ever top what the viewer imagines to fill in the blanks. Used well, this method creates suspense, [[MonsterDelay enhances the ultimate reveal]], and can magnify a simple JumpScare into a [[BringMyBrownPants Brown Pants Scenario]]. Often combined with HellIsThatNoise and ObscuredSpecialEffects. OffscreenTeleportation, {{Unreveal Angle}}s, and implausibly agile monsters using [[AirVentPassageway Air-Vent Passageway]]s are all classic methods of keeping the scary unseen as long as possible. The plot aspect often involves HisNameIs, {{Conveniently Interrupted Document}}s, {{Apocalyptic Log}}s, and/or PlotBasedPhotographObfuscation.
* Just making something mindblowingly scary and showing it in all its well-lit horrific glory -- the hardest to pull off, as it [[TemptingFate risks]] highlighting even minor {{Special Effects Failure}}s unless done superbly, and often has to overcome the lack of menacing atmosphere. On the rare occasions it is done well, however, it can be absolute NightmareFuel, all the more jarring because both [[GenreSavvy viewers and characters]] tend to associate well lit areas with safety -- [[WrongGenreSavvy which is not always the case.]] Numerous particularly well-done instances of this form can be seen in Series/TheWalkingDead, with walkers as likely to attack in open fields in broad daylight as in dark basements, making for prime ParanoiaFuel.

If you cannot tell from the listings below, this is overwhelmingly a {{Film}} trope. Whether this is because producers don't care about silly things like logic, or they just don't have enough time to explain every little idiosyncrasy, is a debate that will rage on for as long as the medium exists.

Compare FridgeLogic. OffscreenTeleportation is a SubTrope of this, as is BodyHorror.

Contrast {{Narm}}, NightmareRetardant, RuleOfCute, which negate a work's potential for fear. Also contrast RealismInducedHorror, which seeks to instill fear in audiences through plausibility.
