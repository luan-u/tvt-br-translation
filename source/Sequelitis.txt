->''"Actually, yeah. ... See, there was a sequel. Wasn't as good."''
-->-- '''Joel''', ''VideoGame/TheLastOfUsPartII'' (referring to ''Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark'')

As the number of installments in a series grows, the probability that the latest entry will be terrible increases geometrically. While the first sequel of a work is something of a coin toss between "totally awesome" and "mediocre", the more they milk the [[CashCowFranchise Cash Cow]], the less cream you see. Of course, works that go to theater have high production values. On the whole, their creators are at least ''trying.'' But if it's DirectToVideo media, the chances that the third one is nothing but unmitigated crap is already close to 100%. This is partially because people assume a DTV work is just something that wasn't good enough to get into theatres. [[SturgeonsLaw And, as a general rule, they tend to be right]].

In other words, {{Sequel}}s to works, generally created on the impetus of box office revenue, are rarely as good as the work they're a sequel to. If there's a third installment, it will frequently mark a sharp downhill turn even when the second work turned out all right. And even if there's a good trilogy, [[TrilogyCreep going beyond]] ''[[TrilogyCreep that]]'' [[TrilogyCreep has an even greater chance of crapitude]].

Common symptoms of Sequelitis -- the elements that contribute to the sequel not being as well-received as the original -- can include, but are not limited to:

* Making a sequel just because the original was successful and the executives want more money, regardless of creative potential or the fans wanting a sequel or not.
* The sequel being unplanned. Many works are written to have a sense of closure, with the creators not having any follow-ups in mind when they were made. This happens much less often nowadays in movies, since just about everyone in the movie industry is aware of this trope, and almost all blockbuster movies are already made with sequels at least on the table, if not outright planned from the start.
* [[SequelReset Undoing the ending of the previous work]] when it gave no room for more stories. The backlash can go double for sequels that [[HappyEndingOverride turn happy endings into the beginning of great suffering, struggle, and conflict]].
* The [[AssPull contrived]] revival or return of a character (particularly a [[JokerImmunity villain]]) who was killed off or kicked out in the first work.
* The attempt to turn a standalone work into a TwoPartTrilogy, with the first work being a single story with a proper ending, but the next two works actually being one story split into two works, resulting in two bloated, incoherent sequels with too little plot stretched between them.
* After a series of good or bad sequels, the creators want to finish the franchise the best way possible or are sick of delivering bad sequels, so they make a work [[GrandFinale intended to end the series]]. They promise this work will be the last, and may even advertise it as the final chapter, but then [[SeriesFauxnale that promise is broken with yet another sequel]].
* In an inversion of the above, the first work may have a planned sequel, but it was self-contained and could be enjoyed on its own. For the second or third works, though, the producers had plans for even more sequels and spin-offs, and filled the sequel with {{Sequel Hook}}s and unfinished plot threads in order to set up upcoming works, as opposed to... you know, making the current one good. This can get even worse with another inversion: [[StillbornFranchise those movies are canceled]], [[LeftHanging leaving those plots unresolved]].
* The original work was thematically rich, but then the sequels were either too {{Anvilicious}} with topics that require tact and subtlety or only scraped the surface of subjects that needed more tact.
* {{Retcon}}s that upset people for whatever reason.
* FranchiseOriginalSin: Early in the franchise there were minor flaws, but as new installments roll in these problems just get out of hand.
* The sequel having a much lower budget than the original. While money alone isn't enough to make a work good, and there are many inferior sequels that have a bigger budget than the original, a bigger budget means that at least the executives have ''some'' faith in the work being a big deal. If a sequel is made on a shoestring budget, it typically means they're just farting it out for a quick buck.
* The [[TheOtherDarrin recasting]] of returning characters with a cheap batch of B-list actors (and not ''just'' those formerly played by child actors who are now too old, big-name stars now busy elsewhere, or older actors who died in the interim).
* The [[ChuckCunninghamSyndrome mysterious unexplained departure]] of a main or major supporting character from the original work, usually because the actor(s) didn't want to return and the filmmakers wouldn't or couldn't recast the role.
* The casual, shameless, meaningless, and sometimes [[DroppedABridgeOnHim callous]] [[SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome killing off of beloved characters]].
* The [[ChuckCunninghamSyndrome mysterious unexplained departure]] of a character like a hero's love interest, usually because the producers thought the {{Shipp|ing}}ers would lose interest in the hero if he or she was married. At most, there may be a [[HandWave throwaway line]] that tells us "it didn't work out". This doesn't stop the hero from getting a new love interest, however.
* The sequel revolving around the (often [[RememberTheNewGuy previously unmentioned]]) relative/friend of a beloved character whose actor can't or won't return, in hopes that a connection to the original character will help make a new character just as popular as the original. This can lead to InNameOnly.
* The sequel being LighterAndSofter than the original, to the point of being labelled a kid's work and alienating most or all of the original's fanbase, or being unnecessarily DarkerAndEdgier and [[AudienceShift adults-only]] just for the sake of it.
* Being [[SamePlotSequel too similar to the previous work(s)]], to the point that it's just the same thing over again. Creators are not realizing that if we want sequels, we want the story to continue, not to be repeated. Comedy films are particularly susceptible to this pitfall, as many comedy sequels tend to rehash not only the plot, but also the most memorable jokes and gags from their predecessors. For the more general trope applying to recycled story arcs, see FleetingDemographicRule.
* Being nothing like the previous work(s), but not because they want to stay fresh or try to innovate, but for other reasons like not being able to do something like the original thanks to the plot/actors/lower budget/rating/licenses/etc, or relying on what is current and/or popular or [[FollowTheLeader trying to be more like other successful movies]].
* {{Wacky Wayside Tribe}}s begin choking the plot to conceal the fact that the writers have basically run out of story.
* The reuse of some element that was felt to be important to the first work's success, in hopes that having [[ExaggeratedTrope even more of that element]] will make the sequel even better. If it works for the first sequel, it will be cranked up more and more in further sequels. This may lead to VulgarHumor, sadistic slapstick violence, or something else along those lines.
* PanderingToTheBase, which can come in several harmful forms that may appear together or separately:
** Potential new audience members become victims of ContinuityLockout when knowledge of the first work - or the source material - is required to understand what's going on.
** ContinuityPorn annoying fans who get the nods and being [[BigLippedAlligatorMoment downright confusing and jarring]] to those who might not even know references are being made.
** Existing fans become irritated when elements they liked in the first work are overused or used poorly. They typically say so, quickly and loudly. This can be caused by the creators having a limited or poor understanding of what the general fanbase liked, leading to their catering to the FanDumb.
** This is particularly the case when bringing back a character who [[EnsembleDarkhorse unexpectedly won the audience over]] in the first work, only [[TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter to do nothing interesting with them]] - or worse, {{Flanderiz|ation}}e them so much that they end up being a one-dimensional caricature of the charming and multi-faceted character the audience fell in love with in the first place.
** The opposite can happen too, where an intentionally wacky story based on RuleOfCool and RuleOfFunny [[CerebusSyndrome tries to ground itself and be more realistic in the sequel]], losing its original charm in the process. However, this seems to be a far less common occurrence than the reverse.
* Making a sequel just to earn more money, but from [[MerchandiseDriven toys and other licensed products]] instead of tickets. It's common for successful works to actually make more money from merchandise than the actual work, even works that only had modest returns. Sequels made to sell toys instead of trying to tell a story can [[Analysis/MerchandiseDriven warp the script in ways]], almost none for the best (e.g. making the movie more "kid-friendly", introducing/focusing on cute/marketable characters, or even [[ChuckCunninghamSyndrome completely ditching]] characters who can't sell toys).
* All the previous sequels [[NumberedSequels had numbers in the title]], but there ended up being ''so many'' that they just {{stopped numbering|Sequels}} them since the audience is aware of this trope and a such a high number in the title may be a bad marketing move.
* In any movie trilogy, [[TrilogyCreep a fourth installment is a bad omen]], especially when the trilogy not only managed to have three decent or even great movies, but also a sense of closure where a fourth movie feels like a square peg in a round hole, fourth movies do better when they are advertised as some sort of spin-off, not really trying to continue after the finished storyline of the trilogy, and don't have the number 4 in the title.
* With adaptations or [[TheRemake remakes]], when all the source material was already covered up in the previous movie(s), [[AdaptationExpansion continuing to churn out sequels with original stories]]--especially when the author of the original source material can't or won't help. Worse, if the new stories aren't faithful to the originals, they can end up looking like bad fanfic. This is especially problematic when doing sequels to well-established works, such as those starring a PublicDomainCharacter; the original is such a classic that the sequel can't help but look a bit blasphemous.
* The writers attempting to up the ante from the previous installments or trying to make the environment bigger and better in the sequel, but working themselves into a corner and making the next sequel a letdown for not living up to the last installment, or for not upping the ante again.

The dreadful compulsion on the part of writers and filmmakers to add new chapters to perfectly good works has been likened to an addiction, sometimes termed 'sequelholism'. The writers sometimes seem aware of this, and as a run of sequels is produced they may drop numbering the works entirely and start [[OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo adding cliché subtitles]]. This only makes it harder to guess the order to watch for new fans. If they ''aren't'' aware of this, then, in the end, odds are FirstInstallmentWins.

The inverse tropes are SurprisinglyImprovedSequel (a good sequel to a mediocre or terrible work) and EvenBetterSequel (an awesome sequel to a good original work). Compare ContestedSequel (when there is considerable division about the sequel's quality), InNameOnly (when a sequel is strangely divergent from its predecessor), VillainBasedFranchise (when a sequel retains the monster or villain but features none of the original heroes) and CapcomSequelStagnation (Where it's the ''same'' game, with minor tweaks and additions, re-released over and over like string of mediocre sequels). Can be caused by a poor choice in SequelEscalation, and lead up to FranchiseZombie if a sequel that should have been a FranchiseKiller doesn't destroy the series. Some fans treat such sequels with FanonDiscontinuity. See also SophomoreSlump, TheProblemWithLicensedGames, and SeasonalRot. For TV series, this can sometimes be a result of a PostScriptSeason. The reason why SequelSnark and RidiculousFutureSequelisation became common jokes. And, of course, ''any and all'' of this can happen just as easily with {{Prequel}}s.
