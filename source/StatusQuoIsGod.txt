->''"Looks like everything's back the way it was! Which is the only way it should ever be..."''
-->-- '''Marge Simpson,''' ''WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons'' [[Recap/TheSimpsonsS15E8MargeVsSSCCATAG S15 E8 Marge Versus Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays]]

Within a work, particularly long-running series and franchises, almost ''nothing'' changes. If something does change, it's generally reset back to the way it was before very quickly.

This usually happens in a series with no overarching conflict or plot, although it is also the final stage of ExponentialPlotDelay, the phenomenon in which the plot of a serial story has totally ground to a halt. In either case, each installment of the series will open under virtually identical circumstances to the installment that came before.

Why create a static situation? The creators want the audience to be familiar with the characters and situation, without having to bother with such things as "what happened last episode".

This trope is especially true for cartoons, where networks want to be free to broadcast reruns in any convenient order or lack thereof. It's also very common in sitcoms and comics, and as a result, there is a lot of AesopAmnesia created. Although characters have learned their lessons or attempted to improve their predicaments, nothing ever really changes.

While this trope can be used to help avoid ContinuityLockout, it also can be very difficult to juggle an unchanging status quo without gradually turning off your audience; characters and situations which never change tend to get stale after a while, and audiences can get a bit tired of seeing the ResetButton being pushed every time it looks like something might happen to change things.

Status Quo Is God can easily collide with HappilyEverAfter. Sometimes, a story simply can't have an ending that is both happy and maintains the status quo--thus, these two powerful tropes are in conflict with each other. When this conflict occurs, it's likely that the status quo will be maintained, and the ending will be less happy than it might have been if not for Status Quo Is God. For example, if a main character gains a significant other at the beginning of the episode, it is almost certain that they will break up by the end, for [[ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies one reason]] or [[MinorFlawMajorBreakup another]]. (On the other hand, if the entire ''series'' is due to end and the creators feel confident that they'll never do a sequel, they may decide to break this trope with a GrandFinale that permanently fixes everything.)

Status Quo Is God is usually the justification for a YoYoPlotPoint or an AgelessBirthdayEpisode. It has nothing to do with [[Music/StatusQuo the divinity of a certain rock band]], however.

NegativeContinuity is what happens when this trope is exaggerated--not only does nothing ever change, it doesn't even require an explanation InUniverse, the world just resets at the end of every episode. See also, AlternateUniverseReedRichardsIsAwesome, in which characters get a glimpse of an alternative universe where things have, in fact, changed.

Related to JustEatGilligan and UnConfession. UnlikelySpare may also be used to this effect. For the opposite, in which a work changes dramatically over the course of its run, see NothingIsTheSameAnymore.

* WeWantOurJerkBack: A mean character becomes nicer but goes back to normal because the other characters ''wanted'' it.

!!Not quite a sub-trope but often overlaps with it:
* BaitTheDog: Sometimes, when a bad character showing its likeable side would modify the status quo, the writers would make that disappear, but not always.
* ButtMonkey: Sometimes, when a character's unchanging status quo makes them unlucky, however, this is not the only reason for a character to be unlucky.
* ConvenientMiscarriage: If the reason it's convenient is because the baby would change the status quo, but not an example if it's convenient to the ''characters''.
* DeathIsCheap: When mortality can easily be [[BackFromTheDead reversed]]. This is not always because of this rule, however, and may be played for other reasons.
* DisneyDeath: Fake deaths are used in place of real deaths. Not always a sub-trope because this is only one of many reasons for a fake death.
* FissionMailed: When losing a game sometimes modifies the status quo, it would subvert it into the game being continued, though it's not always the case.
* AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted: A character suddenly comes into wealth and it is quickly lost, spent, or stolen, especially if the character is established as [[PerpetualPoverty always hard-up for money]].
* IronButtMonkey: A ButtMonkey is exposed to extreme physical abuse, yet [[NighInvulnerability it never dies or gets hurt at all]]. Very common in {{Slapstick}} comedies.
* JerkWithAHeartOfJerk: When the story suggests that a {{jerkass}} might have a [[JerkWithAHeartOfGold nicer side]] but then [[SubvertedTrope doesnâ€™t]] because of the status quo.
* MayItNeverHappenAgain: If the reason the effort is made not to repeat the story is because repeating the story would change the status quo. On the other hand, this is sometimes an '''inversion''' of Status Quo is God, since other times, people ''try'' to change the status quo by ensuring the conflict doesn't repeat.
* ShaggyDogStory: A story's buildup has no payoff.
* ShooOutTheNewGuy: A new character joins the main cast but is then promptly written out. However, this is often due to the [[TheScrappy negative reception]] of the character.
* TheyKilledKennyAgain: A comedic sub-trope of DeathIsCheap and NegativeContinuity. Sometimes done to maintain the status quo but other times it's played purely for BlackComedy.
* UnsuccessfulPetAdoption: Someone adopts a pet, but it runs away or has to go. Maintaining the status quo is one of the reasons to play this trope, but not the only one.
* VillainsActHeroesReact: If the hero were the one with a plan to change the world, a happy ending would involve the status quo changing. So instead, the villain is the one who wants to change the world, and the hero stops him to make sure nothing has to change.
* YankTheDogsChain: Sometimes, the reason for an unlucky character's luck disappearing is because having it stick around would shake up the status quo, but not always.
