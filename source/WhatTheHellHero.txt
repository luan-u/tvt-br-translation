When characters InUniverse call out one or possibly more of the heroes for doing something clearly unheroic, if not outright heinous.

Occasionally, an author will drop some black into their otherwise flawlessly good guy hero... and have others, particularly TheHeart (and ''especially'' TheMcCoy), ''notice.'' This can add guilt and remorse to a character as they [[KickTheMoralityPet feel shame for their evil actions]], and legitimately have to fight to [[ClearMyName restore their name]], [[MustMakeAmends undo the harm]], or simply live with the guilt and shame of it. In this case, you can expect to hear some variation of "Haven't you done enough already?" More extremely, it can be the first step towards AntiHero-dom or a full-blown FaceHeelTurn. A RedemptionQuest is usually considered the most noble or morally good way to respond to this.

The opposite of ProtagonistCenteredMorality; contrast also DesignatedHero and HeroInsurance. See also WhatIsEvil and NotSoDifferentRemark for when a ''villain'' is the one pointing this out, or acting as though there's something to point out to mess with the hero. (A variation is when the villain will ''praise'' the hero, which [[YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame the hero will find profoundly humiliating]].)

If the player is [[ButThouMust given no choice in their decision]] due to {{Railroading}} or multiple choices they can make [[MortonsFork all end with terrible consequences]], and the player is then called out for their actions, they are BlamedForBeingRailroaded.

Almost never applies to those PowersThatBe who have an OmniscientMoralityLicense, although characters who RageAgainstTheHeavens might attempt it. Likewise, villains tend to be immune to this thanks to their ItsAllAboutMe attitude (or, at best, MoralMyopia), though a HeelRealisation might clue them in, perhaps leading to a VillainousBSOD. (This trope doesn't really apply to villains who are just doing it ForTheEvulz.) A villain may also be in the receiving end from another villain that remembers that EvenEvilHasStandards. Those pesky {{Trickster Mentor}}s may also find themselves on the receiving end of RageAgainstTheMentor.

Some video games offer dialogue trees or something similar that might allow your character to call someone out for their horrible behavior, which can be immensely satisfying. If your character is the one being called out, it's WhatTheHellPlayer MyGodWhatHaveIDone may be a self-inflicted version, and this is often associated with a VideoGameCrueltyPunishment. Can come right off the heels of a SadisticChoice foisted on the player in a video game. The hero may attempt to invoke IDidWhatIHadToDo as their justification, though this does not always succeed. Of course, those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, and one should beware of their own MoralMyopia leading to TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong. Results may vary against the SociopathicHero or TheUnfettered; beware you don't get a ShutUpKirk or HannibalLecture in response. EtTuBrute may also counts as this when a hero does not make a full FaceHeelTurn, but gets called out for nearly betraying their allies. If it's a child calling out a parent or vice versa, it's CallingTheOldManOut or CallingTheYoungManOut. Can overlap with TheReasonYouSuckSpeech if a character points out a hero's flaws in very long detail in the most brutal way possible. Can also overlap with CowardiceCallout if the hero is being called out on shortcomings that are rooted in fear or a lack of well-placed courage. A character verbally chastising the hero may realize they [[WasTooHardOnHim were too hard on them]] if they feel uncomfortable in chewing out the hero. The hero may lash out at the reproof if they CantTakeCriticism.

Of course, the critics aren't necessarily infallible themselves. There may be times when those making the criticism may not be aware of extenuating factors for the heroes. Sometimes, those making a What The Hell Hero statement can get one in return- an AntiHero may call TheHero out on being too inflexible to do what is necessary, while the hero may respond that their critic's methods are little better than those of the villains.

'''Important note''': This article is ''exclusively'' about scenes where the hero is called on their morally ambiguous or directly evil actions by characters ''in the story''. '''If the DesignatedHero is a {{Jerkass}} (or worse), but no one calls them on it in the series, then take your example to DesignatedHero. Good-intended mistakes fall under NiceJobBreakingItHero.''' Reviewers can call out this in their reviews, but they themselves are not engaging in What the Hell, Hero? as they are not part of the series being criticized. A skit still has to be based on events in the series; not something they make up so they can do the criticizing themselves.
